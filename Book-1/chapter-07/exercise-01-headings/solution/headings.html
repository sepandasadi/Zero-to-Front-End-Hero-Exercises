  <h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the exciting world of web development! This guide will introduce you to the fundamentals of building websites and web applications.</p>

  <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
  <p>Web development encompasses all the work involved in building and maintaining websites and web applications.</p>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet or an intranet. It involves writing code, designing interfaces, and ensuring functionality across different devices and browsers.</p>

  <h3>Why Learn Web Development?</h3>
  <p>Learning web development opens doors to numerous opportunities. The web is constantly evolving, and skilled developers are always in demand. You can build your own projects, work for companies, or freelance—all while creating things that millions of people can use.</p>

  <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
  <p>Web developers are needed in virtually every industry. Whether you want to work at a tech startup, a large corporation, or start your own business, web development skills are invaluable. Salaries are competitive, and remote work opportunities are abundant.</p>

  <h2>Front-End vs Back-End</h2>
  <p>Web development is typically divided into two main categories: front-end and back-end development.</p>

  <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
  <p>Front-end developers work on everything users see and interact with in their browsers. This includes layout, design, animations, and user interface elements. The primary technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

  <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
  <p>Back-end developers work on the server side of web applications. They handle databases, user authentication, server logic, and API integration. Common languages include Python, Node.js, Ruby, and PHP.</p>

  <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
  <p>Full-stack developers work on both front-end and back-end. They understand the complete web development process and can build entire applications independently. This versatility makes them highly valuable in the job market.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Ready to begin your web development journey? Here's what you need to know.</p>

  <h3>Essential Skills</h3>
  <p>To become a proficient web developer, you'll need to master several core technologies and tools.</p>

  <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
  <p>HTML provides the structure of web pages, while CSS handles styling and layout. These are the foundational languages every web developer must know. Start here, and you'll be creating beautiful web pages in no time.</p>

  <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
  <p>JavaScript adds interactivity to websites. It allows you to respond to user actions, manipulate content dynamically, and create engaging user experiences. Modern web development relies heavily on JavaScript.</p>

  <h4>Version Control with Git</h4>
  <p>Git is essential for managing code changes and collaborating with other developers. Learning Git early in your journey will save you headaches later and is expected by most employers.</p>

  <h3>Learning Resources</h3>
  <p>There are countless free and paid resources available online. Interactive coding platforms, video tutorials, documentation sites, and coding communities can all help you on your journey. This book is a great starting point!</p>

  <h3>Your First Project</h3>
  <p>The best way to learn is by building. Start with a simple personal website, then gradually add features and complexity. Don't worry about perfection—focus on learning and improving with each project.</p>
