## 📖 How to Use These Exercises

### For Each Exercise:

1. **Read the instructions** carefully
2. **Start with the starter file** - resist the urge to peek at solutions!
3. **Use semantic tags** - choose elements based on meaning, not appearance
4. **Test your HTML** - Open in a browser and check the structure
5. **Validate** - Use the W3C HTML validator
6. **Compare with solution** - Only after you've tried it yourself!

### Testing Your Semantic HTML

For each exercise, verify:
- ✅ Headings follow proper hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping)
- ✅ Semantic tags are used appropriately
- ✅ Content meaning is clear from the HTML alone
- ✅ No "div soup" - divs only when necessary
- ✅ Valid HTML (no errors in validator)
- ✅ Accessible and screen-reader friendly

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Think semantically** - What does this content *mean*, not how should it *look*
2. **Use the right tool** - Each HTML element has a purpose
3. **Build hierarchy** - Use headings to create clear document outlines
4. **Consider accessibility** - Screen readers rely on semantic HTML
5. **Validate often** - Catch errors early
6. **Read out loud** - Does the HTML structure make sense when you describe it?

## 🚀 Going Further

Once you complete the exercises:

1. **View the page outline** - Use browser extensions to see heading structure
2. **Test with a screen reader** - Understand how assistive technology interprets your HTML
3. **Add CSS** (if you've reached Chapter 11!) - Style without changing the semantic meaning
4. **Build your own pages** - Practice on real projects
5. **Share your work** - Get feedback from the community

## 🆘 Need Help?
