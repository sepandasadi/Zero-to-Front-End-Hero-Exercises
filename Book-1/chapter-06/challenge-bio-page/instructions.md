# Challenge Project: Personal Bio Page

## 🎯 Goal

Build a complete, professional personal biography page that demonstrates mastery of all Chapter 6 concepts.

## 📋 Project Requirements

Create a file called `bio.html` that showcases everything you've learned about HTML basics.

### Required Structure

**1. Document Setup:**
- [ ] Proper HTML5 DOCTYPE
- [ ] Complete `<html>` element with `lang` attribute
- [ ] Well-formed `<head>` section with all meta tags
- [ ] Descriptive `<title>` (e.g., "About Sepand Asadi - Web Developer")

**2. Content Sections (in `<body>`):**

#### Hero Section:
- [ ] Main heading (`<h1>`) with your name
- [ ] A brief tagline or subtitle

#### About Me Section:
- [ ] Subheading (`<h2>`): "About Me"
- [ ] 2-3 paragraphs introducing yourself
- [ ] Use `<strong>` and `<em>` for emphasis where appropriate

#### Interests/Hobbies Section:
- [ ] Subheading (`<h2>`): "My Interests" (or "What I Love")
- [ ] Unordered list (`<ul>`) of 4-5 interests or hobbies

#### Skills/Goals Section (Optional):
- [ ] Subheading (`<h2>`): "Skills I'm Learning" or "My Goals"
- [ ] Ordered list (`<ol>`) of skills or goals

#### Contact/Connect Section:
- [ ] Subheading (`<h2>`): "Get in Touch" or "Let's Connect"
- [ ] Paragraph with links to:
  - Email (mailto link)
  - GitHub (opens in new tab)
  - LinkedIn (opens in new tab)
  - Or other social profiles

#### Visual Elements:
- [ ] At least one image (photo, avatar, or placeholder)
- [ ] All images have appropriate `alt` text

### Quality Requirements

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] All tags properly nested
- [ ] Proper indentation (2 or 4 spaces consistent)
- [ ] Helpful comments for each major section
- [ ] No broken tags or syntax errors

**Accessibility:**
- [ ] Descriptive alt text for all images
- [ ] Proper link attributes (`target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links)
- [ ] Semantic heading structure (`<h1>` → `<h2>` progression)

**Best Practices:**
- [ ] Meaningful page title in `<title>` tag
- [ ] Character encoding specified
- [ ] Viewport meta tag for responsive design
- [ ] Links use descriptive text (not "click here")

## 📝 Starter Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>About [Your Name]</title>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- ========== HERO SECTION ========== -->


  <!-- ========== ABOUT ME SECTION ========== -->


  <!-- ========== INTERESTS SECTION ========== -->


  <!-- ========== CONTACT SECTION ========== -->


</body>
</html>
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your bio page should:
- [ ] Load without errors in the browser
- [ ] Display all content clearly and readably
- [ ] Have working links that behave correctly
- [ ] Show images (or appropriate alt text if missing)
- [ ] Pass HTML validation (https://validator.w3.org/)
- [ ] Be well-organized with clear sections
- [ ] Use proper semantic HTML throughout

## 🚀 Bonus Challenges

Take your bio page to the next level:

- [ ] Add a "table of contents" with links that jump to each section using IDs
- [ ] Include a quote you love (look up the `<blockquote>` tag!)
- [ ] Add a "Back to Top" link at the bottom
- [ ] Include multiple images in a gallery
- [ ] Add a horizontal rule (`<hr>`) between sections
- [ ] Write a comment noting what you want to improve when you learn CSS
- [ ] Use a favicon (the little icon in the browser tab)

## 💡 Design Tips (for later with CSS)

While building your bio page, think about:
- Where you might want to add colors later
- Which sections might need background images
- How you'll make it responsive on mobile
- What interactive elements you might add with JavaScript

Add comments like:
```html
<!-- TODO: Add blue background and white text with CSS -->
<!-- TODO: Make this a button with hover effect -->
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Before submitting:

1. **Browser test**: Open in Chrome and Firefox
2. **Link test**: Click every link to verify they work
3. **Image test**: Verify images display or show alt text
4. **Console check**: Open DevTools (F12) - no errors?
5. **Validation**: Run through https://validator.w3.org/
6. **Source view**: Right-click → View Page Source - does code look clean?
7. **Mobile test**: Resize browser window to simulate mobile

## 📊 Estimated Time

## 💪 Final Tips

1. **Type it yourself** - Don't copy-paste from the solution
2. **Make it personal** - Use real information about yourself
3. **Have fun** - This is YOUR page, make it reflect who you are!
4. **Iterate** - Build it in stages, testing as you go
5. **Comment everything** - Future you will thank present you
6. **Commit to Git** - If you're using Git, this is great practice!

**Remember**: This is just the HTML structure. In the CSS chapters, you'll make it beautiful. In the JavaScript chapters, you'll make it interactive. But for now, focus on creating solid, semantic HTML!
