# Exercise 04: Lookaheads & Capturing Groups

## 🎯 Objective

Master advanced regex features: capturing groups, named groups, lookaheads/lookbehinds, and backreferences.

## 📋 Tasks

### Task 1: Capturing Groups
Extract parts from strings:
- Parse name from "Last, First" format
- Extract area code from phone number
- Capture domain from email

### Task 2: Named Groups
Use named capturing groups (?<name>):
- Parse date with named groups
- Extract URL components
- More readable than numbered groups

### Task 3: Lookaheads
Non-consuming assertions:
- Positive lookahead `(?=...)`
- Negative lookahead `(?!...)`
- Password validation with multiple requirements

### Task 4: Lookbehinds
- Positive lookbehind `(?<=...)`
- Negative lookbehind `(?<!...)`
- Extract prices with currency symbols

### Task 5: Backreferences
Match repeated patterns:
- Find duplicate words
- Match opening/closing tags
- Validate balanced quotes

### Task 6: Real-World Parsing
Parse complex formats:
- ISO dates
- CSS colors (rgb, hex, hsl)
- File paths

## ⏱️ Estimated Time: 45-55 minutes
