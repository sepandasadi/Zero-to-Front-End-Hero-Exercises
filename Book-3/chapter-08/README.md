# Chapter 8: Creating a Design System - Exercises

Welcome to the Chapter 8 exercises! In this chapter, you learned how to build production-ready design systems from scratch.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Build a complete design token system
- Create primitive and composite components
- Document components with Storybook
- Implement theming (light/dark mode)
- Audit existing apps for design system opportunities

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose an exercise** from the list above
2. **Read the README** in each exercise folder
3. **Try it yourself** first (starter code provided)
4. **Check hints** if you get stuck
5. **Compare with solution** when complete

## 💡 Tips for Success

**Design Systems:**
- Start small (5-10 components)
- Use semantic token names (`--color-primary` not `--color-blue`)
- Document everything (Storybook)
- Make components accessible by default
- Think composition over configuration

**Tokens:**
- Follow 4px or 8px spacing scale
- Use nested tokens for theming
- Generate from JSON for multi-platform support

**Components:**
- Keep primitives simple
- Build composites from primitives
- Test accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)
- Include loading and error states
