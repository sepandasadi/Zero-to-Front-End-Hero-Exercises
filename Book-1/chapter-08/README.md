## 📖 How to Use These Exercises

### For Each Exercise:

1. **Read the instructions** in the `instructions.md` file
2. **Start with the starter file** - don't peek at the solution!
3. **Test your work** - Open your HTML file in a browser
4. **Check accessibility** - Use browser DevTools to check for issues
5. **Compare with solution** - Only after you've tried it yourself!

### Testing Your Forms

Since these exercises don't have backend servers, forms won't actually submit anywhere. That's okay! You're practicing:
- HTML structure
- Validation attributes
- Accessibility
- User experience

To test form validation:
1. Try submitting without filling required fields
2. Enter invalid data (like "abc" in an email field)
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect the HTML
4. Test keyboard navigation (Tab through the form)

### Accessibility Testing

For each form and table, verify:
- ✅ Every input has a connected label
- ✅ Tables have proper headers with `scope` attributes
- ✅ Forms have logical structure with fieldsets
- ✅ Required fields are indicated visually AND with `required` attribute
- ✅ You can navigate the entire form using only the keyboard

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Get the basic structure working first, then enhance
2. **Test frequently** - Open your file in a browser after every change
3. **Use semantic HTML** - Choose the right element for the job
4. **Think about the user** - Would this form be easy to fill out?
5. **Validate everything** - Use `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`, etc.
6. **Don't skip labels** - Every input needs a label!

## 🚀 Going Further

Once you complete the exercises:

1. **Style them with CSS** (if you've reached Chapter 11!)
2. **Add more validation** with custom patterns
3. **Create your own forms** for your portfolio projects
4. **Test with a screen reader** to truly understand accessibility
5. **Share your work** on GitHub or CodePen!
