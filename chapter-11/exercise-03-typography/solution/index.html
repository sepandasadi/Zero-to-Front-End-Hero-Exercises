    <h1>The Art of Typography</h1>
    <p class="lead">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.</p>

    <h2>What is Typography?</h2>
    <p>Typography involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, and adjusting the space between pairs of letters. The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.</p>

    <h2>Why Typography Matters</h2>
    <p>Good typography establishes a strong visual hierarchy, provides a graphic balance to the website, and sets the product's overall tone. Typography should guide and inform users, optimize readability and accessibility, and ensure an excellent user experience.</p>

    <h3>Key Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hierarchy and contrast</li>
      <li>Consistency and repetition</li>
      <li>Alignment and spacing</li>
      <li>Color and contrast</li>
    </ul>

      "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form."

    <h2>Typography in Web Design</h2>
    <p>On the web, typography is even more critical. With limited attention spans and countless distractions, your typography needs to work harder to grab and hold attention while maintaining readability across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

    <p>By following typographic best practices, you can create text that is not only beautiful to look at but also easy to read and understand. This improves user experience and helps communicate your message more effectively.</p>
