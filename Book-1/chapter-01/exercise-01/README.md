# Exercise 1: Web Exploration

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to identify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real websites by using browser developer tools.

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open three different websites** (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, a news site)

2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)

3. **For each website, document:**
   - What HTML elements do you see in the Elements/Inspector tab?
   - What CSS properties are being used? (Check the Styles panel)
   - Can you find any JavaScript? (Check the Console tab for messages)
   - What happens when you disable JavaScript? (in Settings)

4. **Create a document** (`web-exploration-notes.md`) with your findings

## 💡 Example Format

```markdown
## Website 1: [Name]

**URL**: [website URL]

### HTML Observations
- Uses <header>, <nav>, <main> semantic elements
- Contains a lot of <div> elements

- Color scheme: #hexcolors
- Responsive design with media queries

### JavaScript Observations
- Interactive dropdown menus
- Form validation
- Animated scrolling effects
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Analyzed 3 different websites
- [ ] Identified HTML elements in each
- [ ] Found CSS properties being used
- [ ] Observed JavaScript functionality
- [ ] Documented findings clearly

## 🆘 Hints
