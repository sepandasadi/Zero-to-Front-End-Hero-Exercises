## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip the console methods** - They're your fastest debugging tool
2. **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you exactly what's wrong
3. **Use breakpoints liberally** - See what's actually happening
4. **Verify your assumptions** - console.log values before operations
5. **Change one thing at a time** - Know what fixed the problem
6. **Practice defensive programming** - Prevent errors before they happen
