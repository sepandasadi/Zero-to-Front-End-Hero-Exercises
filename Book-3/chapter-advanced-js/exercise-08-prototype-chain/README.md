# Exercise 8: Prototype Chain Check ⭐

## 🎯 Objective

Explore how prototype inheritance works and verify the prototype chain.

## 📝 Instructions

Investigate the prototype chain using various methods and properties.

### Requirements

Use these methods to explore prototypes:
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`
- `obj.isPrototypeOf(other)`
- `obj instanceof Constructor`
- `obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)`

## 🎁 Bonus Challenges

1. Create a 3-level prototype chain
2. Override a method from the prototype
3. Use `Object.create()` to set prototypes manually

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Understand the prototype chain
- Can check if object has own property vs inherited
- Can traverse up the prototype chain
