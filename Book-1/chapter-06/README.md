## 🎓 Success Criteria

You'll know you've mastered this chapter when you can:
- [ ] Write a complete HTML5 document from memory
- [ ] Properly nest elements without errors
- [ ] Use attributes correctly for links, images, and styling
- [ ] Debug common HTML syntax errors
- [ ] Create a multi-section webpage with semantic structure
- [ ] Validate your HTML with no errors

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Type, don't copy-paste** - Muscle memory is important!
2. **Use VS Code's autocomplete** - Press Tab to complete tags
3. **Check your work** - Open files in a browser after each change
4. **Use the HTML validator** - https://validator.w3.org/
5. **View source** - Right-click your page and "View Page Source" to see your HTML
6. **Indent properly** - Makes code readable (VS Code does this automatically with Prettier)

## 🔧 Setup

Before starting:

1. Create a folder for Chapter 6 exercises in your `frontend-journey` folder:
   ```
   frontend-journey/01-html-basics/chapter-06/
   ```

2. Have VS Code and Live Server ready

3. Have a browser open (Chrome or Firefox recommended)

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Page shows code instead of rendering
**Solution**: Make sure you saved the file with `.html` extension, not `.txt`

### Issue: Image doesn't show
**Solution**: Check the `src` path - is the image in the same folder? Use relative paths correctly.

### Issue: Link doesn't work
**Solution**: Check your `href` attribute - did you include `https://` for external links?

### Issue: Tags are visible on the page
**Solution**: You probably forgot a closing `>` bracket somewhere

### Issue: Everything looks like one big paragraph
**Solution**: Check your nesting - you might have unclosed tags or wrong closing order
