# Exercise 6: State Management Comparison

## 🎯 Objective

Build the SAME feature using Context, Redux Toolkit, and Zustand. Compare approaches, understand trade-offs, make informed decisions.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Comparing all state solutions
- Performance analysis
- Code complexity comparison
- Decision-making criteria
- Trade-offs and benefits

## 🎨 What You'll Build

**The Same App, Three Ways:**

A user preferences manager with:
- Theme selection (light/dark/high-contrast)
- Language preference
- Notification settings
- Save to localStorage

Build it with:
1. **Context API + useReducer**
2. **Redux Toolkit**
3. **Zustand**

## 📋 Requirements

**Each Implementation Must:**
- Manage same state (theme, language, notifications)
- Persist to localStorage
- Provide same functionality
- Have clean code structure

**Then Compare:**
- Lines of code
- Boilerplate needed
- Developer experience
- Performance (React DevTools Profiler)
- Learning curve
- When you'd choose each

## 💡 Comparison Matrix

Create a table comparing:

| Aspect | Context | Redux Toolkit | Zustand |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Setup Lines | ? | ? | ? |
| Provider Needed? | Yes | Yes | No |
| Boilerplate | ? | ? | ? |
| DevTools | No | Yes | Yes (addon) |
| TypeScript | ? | ? | ? |
| Best For | ? | ? | ? |

## 🎯 Analysis Questions

Answer these:
1. Which was easiest to set up?
2. Which has best DX (Developer Experience)?
3. Which would you use for a small app?
4. Which for a large app?
5. Which has best performance?
6. Which has most boilerplate?
7. When would you choose each?

## 📊 Deliverables

- 3 working implementations
- Comparison document (comparison.md)
- Performance measurements
- Personal recommendation with reasoning

**Estimated Time:** 90-120 minutes
