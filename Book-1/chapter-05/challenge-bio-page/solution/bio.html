  <!-- ========== ABOUT ME SECTION ========== -->
  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hello! I'm [Your Name], a passionate learner on my journey to becoming a
    <strong>front-end web developer</strong>. I've always been fascinated by how
    websites work, and I love the idea of creating experiences that people
    interact with every day. There's something magical about taking an idea
    and turning it into something tangible that lives on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before diving into web development, I worked in graphic design, which gave
    me a strong foundation in <em>visual communication and user experience</em>.
    Now I'm excited to combine my design background with coding skills to create
    websites that are not only beautiful but also <strong>functional and accessible</strong>
    to everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    My learning journey has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. Every time
    I solve a problem or build something new, I feel a sense of accomplishment
    that keeps me motivated. I'm particularly interested in responsive design,
    accessibility, and creating smooth, delightful user interactions.
