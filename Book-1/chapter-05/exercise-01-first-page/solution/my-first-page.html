  <p>
    Hello! I'm [Your Name], and I'm embarking on an exciting journey to become a
    <strong>front-end web developer</strong>. I've always been fascinated by
    how websites work, and now I'm finally taking the leap to learn how to
    build them myself.
  </p>

  <!-- Paragraph about why I'm learning -->
  <p>
    I'm learning web development because I want to <em>create amazing user experiences</em>
    and bring my creative ideas to life on the web. My goal is to build websites
    that are not only beautiful but also accessible and functional for everyone.
    I'm particularly interested in creating responsive designs that work seamlessly
    across all devices!
