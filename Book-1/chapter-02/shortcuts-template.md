## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't memorize everything at once** - Learn shortcuts gradually as you need them
2. **Muscle memory takes time** - It might feel slower at first, but stick with it!
3. **Customize your shortcuts** - Go to `File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts` to change them
4. **Use Command Palette** - When you forget a shortcut, `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` shows everything

**Remember**: Even experienced developers don't know every shortcut. Focus on the ones you use most often!

🚀 Happy coding!
