3. Dropdown Menu
4. Tabs Interface

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Start with one component at a time
3. Test with keyboard navigation
4. Test with screen reader
5. Run Lighthouse audit

## ✅ Requirements

Each component must:
- [ ] Be fully keyboard accessible
- [ ] Use proper ARIA attributes
- [ ] Work with screen readers
- [ ] Have visible focus indicators
- [ ] Pass Lighthouse accessibility audit (100 score)

## 📚 Resources

- [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
- [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/)
- [MDN Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

## 🧪 Testing

See `TESTING.md` for full testing checklist.

**Quick tests:**
1. Unplug your mouse - can you use everything with keyboard?
2. Turn on a screen reader - does it make sense?
3. Run Lighthouse - do you get 100 accessibility score?

## 💡 Tips

- Start with semantic HTML
- Add ARIA only when needed
- Test early and often
- Use the ARIA patterns guide as reference
- Don't forget focus management!
