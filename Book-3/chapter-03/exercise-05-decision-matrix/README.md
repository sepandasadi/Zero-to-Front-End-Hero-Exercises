# Exercise 5: CSS Approach Decision Matrix

## Overview

Practice making informed decisions about styling approaches for different project scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

- ✅ Understand trade-offs between CSS solutions
- ✅ Match approaches to project requirements
- ✅ Consider team skills and project constraints
- ✅ Make data-driven architecture decisions

## The Challenge

You'll be given **5 different project scenarios**. For each, you must:

1. Analyze the requirements
2. Consider constraints (team, timeline, budget)
3. Choose the best styling approach(es)
4. Justify your decision
5. Identify risks

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Startup MVP
- 2 developers, 4-week timeline
- Need to ship fast
- Design might change frequently
- Tech stack: React

### Scenario 2: Enterprise Dashboard
- 10 developers, 6-month project
- Complex, data-heavy UI
- Design system required
- Tech stack: Angular, TypeScript

### Scenario 3: Marketing Site
- SEO critical, performance critical
- Designer provides exact mockups
- Rarely updated
- Tech stack: Static HTML

### Scenario 4: Component Library
- Used by 5+ teams
- Must be framework-agnostic
- Theming required
- Long-term maintenance

### Scenario 5: Legacy Refactor
- 5-year-old jQuery app
- Can't rewrite from scratch
- Gradual modernization
- Mixed team skill levels

## Styling Options to Consider

1. **Plain CSS** - Vanilla, no tools
2. **Sass/SCSS** - Preprocessor
3. **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS
4. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first
5. **CSS-in-JS** (styled-components, Emotion)
6. **BEM Methodology** - Naming convention
7. **Component Library** (MUI, Chakra UI)

## Deliverable

Create a decision matrix document that includes:

- **For each scenario:**
  - Recommended approach
  - Justification (3-5 reasons)
  - Alternative considered
  - Implementation plan
  - Risks and mitigation
  - Success metrics

## Evaluation Criteria

- Depth of analysis
- Consideration of trade-offs
- Realistic constraints
- Clear justification
- Risk awareness

## Time Estimate

45-60 minutes
