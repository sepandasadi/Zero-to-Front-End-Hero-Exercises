## 1. Choose Your Color Theme

Your theme affects how code looks and can reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

### How to Change Theme:

1. Press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K Cmd+T` (Mac)
2. Use arrow keys to preview themes
3. Press Enter to select one

### Popular Themes:

**Built-in Themes:**
- **Dark+ (default dark)** - VS Code's default, great for low-light
- **Light+ (default light)** - Clean, easy on eyes in bright environments
- **Monokai** - Classic, high contrast

**Popular Extensions to Try:**
- **One Dark Pro** - Atom's iconic theme
- **Dracula Official** - Easy on eyes, great colors
- **Night Owl** - Designed for late-night coding
- **Material Theme** - Based on Google's Material Design
- **GitHub Theme** - If you love GitHub's look

### To Install a Theme Extension:

1. Open Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
2. Search for the theme name
3. Click "Install"
4. Click "Set Color Theme" button that appears

## 2. Adjust Font Size

Find a font size that's comfortable for your eyes and screen.

### How to Change Font Size:

1. Go to `File → Preferences → Settings` (or `Code → Preferences → Settings` on Mac)
2. In the search bar, type "Font Size"
3. Find "Editor: Font Size"
4. Try these sizes:
   - **12px** - Smaller, fits more code on screen
   - **14px** - Good balance (recommended for most)
   - **16px** - Larger, easier to read
   - **18px+** - Great for presentations or large monitors

**Pro tip**: You can also use `Ctrl+Plus` / `Ctrl+Minus` (or `Cmd+Plus` / `Cmd+Minus`) to zoom in/out temporarily!

## 3. Change Font Family (Optional)

Some developers prefer special coding fonts that make code easier to read.

### Popular Coding Fonts:

- **Fira Code** - Beautiful, includes programming ligatures
- **JetBrains Mono** - Designed specifically for developers
- **Cascadia Code** - Microsoft's modern coding font
- **Source Code Pro** - Adobe's open-source coding font

### How to Install and Use a New Font:

1. Download and install the font on your computer
2. In VS Code Settings, search "Font Family"
3. Add the font name: `'Fira Code', 'Courier New', monospace`
4. (Optional) Enable ligatures for Fira Code:
   - Search for "Font Ligatures" in settings
   - Check the box to enable

## 4. Enable Auto Save

Never lose work again! Auto Save saves your files automatically.

### How to Enable:

1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Auto Save"
3. Find "Files: Auto Save"
4. Change from "off" to "afterDelay"
5. (Optional) Adjust "Auto Save Delay" (default is 1000ms = 1 second)

**Options:**
- **off** - Manual save only (Ctrl+S)
- **afterDelay** - Saves after you stop typing (recommended!)
- **onFocusChange** - Saves when you click away
- **onWindowChange** - Saves when you switch apps

---

## 5. Configure Tab Settings

Set how your tabs and indentation work.

### Recommended Settings:

1. In Settings, search "Tab Size"
2. Set "Editor: Tab Size" to **2** or **4** (2 is common for HTML/CSS/JS)
3. Enable "Editor: Insert Spaces" (uses spaces instead of tabs)
4. Enable "Editor: Detect Indentation" (auto-detects project style)

---

## 6. Show Minimap (Optional)

The minimap gives you a bird's-eye view of your code.

### How to Toggle:

1. In Settings, search "Minimap"
2. Check/uncheck "Editor: Minimap: Enabled"

**Try both** - some developers love it, others find it distracting!

---

## 7. Format on Save (Recommended!)

Automatically format your code every time you save (requires Prettier extension).

### How to Enable:

1. Install **Prettier** extension (if you haven't already)
2. In Settings, search "Format On Save"
3. Check "Editor: Format On Save"

Now your code will automatically look beautiful every time you hit Ctrl+S!

---

## 8. Open Integrated Terminal

Learn where your terminal lives in VS Code.

### How to Open:

- Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key) or `` Cmd+` `` (Mac)
- Or go to `Terminal → New Terminal`

### Try These Terminal Commands:

```bash
pwd          # Print Working Directory (where am I?)
ls           # List files (Mac/Linux)
dir          # List files (Windows)
node -v      # Check Node.js version
npm -v       # Check npm version
```

---

## 9. Customize Your Layout

Arrange VS Code windows to match your workflow.

### Options to Try:

- **Toggle Sidebar**: `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B`
- **Toggle Panel**: `Ctrl+J` / `Cmd+J` (where terminal lives)
- **Split Editor**: `Ctrl+\` / `Cmd+\` (view two files side-by-side)
- **Zen Mode**: `Ctrl+K Z` / `Cmd+K Z` (distraction-free coding)
