## 📖 Reference

Key concepts from Chapter 13:

**Position Values:**
- `static` - Default, normal flow
- `relative` - Positioned relative to normal position
- `absolute` - Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
- `fixed` - Positioned relative to viewport
- `sticky` - Hybrid of relative and fixed

**Z-Index:**
- Only works on positioned elements
- Higher values appear on top
- Creates stacking contexts

**Common Patterns:**
- Parent: `position: relative` + Child: `position: absolute`
- Fixed header with body padding
- Sticky headers within scrolling containers
- Modal overlays with high z-index
