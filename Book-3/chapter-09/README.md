## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose an exercise**
2. **Read the README** in each folder
3. **Try it yourself** first
4. **Check hints** if stuck
5. **Compare with solution**

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Core Web Vitals:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): ≤ 2.5s
- INP (Interaction to Next Paint): ≤ 200ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): ≤ 0.1

**Optimization Priority:**
1. Images (biggest impact)
2. Code splitting (reduce initial load)
3. Caching (instant repeat visits)
4. Framework optimizations

**Tools:**
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
- WebPageTest
- Bundle analyzers
- Real User Monitoring

---

## 📊 Performance Targets

**Good Performance:**
- Lighthouse score: 90+
- LCP: < 2.5s
- INP: < 200ms
- CLS: < 0.1
- Total bundle: < 200KB (gzipped)
- Images: WebP/AVIF format

**Excellent Performance:**
- Lighthouse score: 95+
- LCP: < 1.5s
- INP: < 100ms
- CLS: < 0.05
- Total bundle: < 100KB
- All assets on CDN

---

## 🔧 Required Tools

- Chrome DevTools
- Node.js & npm
- Image optimization tools (Sharp, Squoosh)
- Bundle analyzer (webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-bundle-visualizer)
