# Exercise 3: Lists

## 🎯 Objective

Practice creating different types of lists: unordered (`<ul>`), ordered (`<ol>`), and description lists (`<dl>`). Learn when to use each type and how to nest them.

## 📋 Requirements

Create a page about "Web Development Tools" that includes:

**1. Unordered List**
- Create a list of "Essential Developer Tools"
- At least 5 items
- Example: Code Editor, Browser, Git, etc.

**2. Ordered List**
- Create a "Steps to Deploy a Website"
- At least 5 numbered steps
- Show a process/sequence

**3. Nested List**
- Create a "Front-End Technologies" list with subcategories:
  - HTML (with sub-items: Elements, Attributes, Semantic tags)
  - CSS (with sub-items: Selectors, Flexbox, Grid)
  - JavaScript (with sub-items: Variables, Functions, DOM)

**4. Description List**
- Create a glossary of web development terms
- At least 5 term-definition pairs
- Example: HTML - HyperText Markup Language, used for structure

**5. Mixed Nested List (Bonus)**
- Combine ordered and unordered lists
- Example: Recipe with ingredients (unordered) and steps (ordered)

## ✅ Requirements

- ✅ At least one example of `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>`
- ✅ Proper nesting (lists inside list items)
- ✅ At least one nested list (2+ levels deep)
- ✅ Appropriate list type for each use case
- ✅ Proper HTML structure

## 💡 Tips

1. Use `<ul>` for unordered collections
2. Use `<ol>` for sequences/procedures
3. Use `<dl>` for term-definition pairs
4. Nest lists by putting them INSIDE `<li>` elements
5. Don't nest lists directly inside each other
