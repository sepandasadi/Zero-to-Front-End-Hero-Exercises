# Archived Projects

This folder contains capstone projects from Edition 1 that have been replaced in Edition 2 of the Zero to Front-End Hero book series.

## Why Were These Projects Archived?

Edition 2 represents a significant update to the Zero to Front-End Hero curriculum with:
- Refined learning objectives and scope
- Updated project requirements that better align with modern web development practices
- More focused capstone projects that better synthesize each volume's content

While these archived projects are no longer the official capstone projects for the book series, they remain valuable learning resources.
