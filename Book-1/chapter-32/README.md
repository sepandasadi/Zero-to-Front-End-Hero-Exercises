# Chapter 32: Advanced JavaScript Patterns - Exercises

Master the most advanced JavaScript features used in frameworks and libraries!

## 📚 What You'll Practice

- **Generators & Iterators** - Pauseable functions and custom iteration
- **Proxy & Reflect** - Intercept and customize object behavior
- **WeakMap & WeakSet** - Memory-efficient collections
- **Symbols** - Unique identifiers and meta-programming

## 🎯 Exercises

### Intermediate Level
1. **Generators & Iterators** - Create custom iterables and lazy sequences
2. **Proxy Basics** - Intercept object operations
3. **WeakMap & Private Data** - Implement true privacy

### Advanced Level
- **Challenge: Reactive State** - Build a mini state management system

## ⚠️ Important Note

These are **advanced patterns**. You don't need them every day, but they're powerful when you do!

**You're ready for these if you:**
- Understand closures, scope, and `this`
- Are comfortable with classes and objects
- Have built some real projects
- Want to understand how frameworks work internally

## 💡 Tips

- Take your time with these concepts
- Experiment in the console
- Read the examples carefully
- Don't worry if they feel complex at first

**These patterns power:**
- Vue's reactivity (Proxy)
- Redux Toolkit's Immer (Proxy)
- RxJS observables (Generators)
- Framework internals

Happy coding at the advanced level! 🚀
