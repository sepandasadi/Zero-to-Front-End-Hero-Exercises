# Exercise 1: Headings and Hierarchy

## 🎯 Objective

Practice creating proper heading hierarchies for different types of content. Learn to use `<h1>` through `<h6>` correctly without skipping levels.

## 📋 Requirements

Create a page about "Introduction to Web Development" with the following structure:

**Main Topic (h1):**
- Introduction to Web Development

**Major Sections (h2):**
- What is Web Development?
- Front-End vs Back-End
- Getting Started

**Subsections (h3) under "What is Web Development?":**
- Definition
- Why Learn Web Development?
- Career Opportunities

**Subsections (h3) under "Front-End vs Back-End":**
- Front-End Development
- Back-End Development
- Full-Stack Development

**Subsections (h3) under "Getting Started":**
- Essential Skills
- Learning Resources
- Your First Project

**Sub-subsections (h4) under "Essential Skills":**
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript Basics
- Version Control with Git

## ✅ Requirements

- ✅ One `<h1>` for the main page title
- ✅ Three `<h2>` tags for major sections
- ✅ Nine `<h3>` tags for subsections
- ✅ Three `<h4>` tags for sub-subsections
- ✅ No skipped heading levels
- ✅ Logical hierarchy
- ✅ Add brief paragraph content under each heading

## 💡 Tips

1. Start with h1 and work your way down
2. Never skip levels (don't go from h2 to h4)
3. Headings should describe content, not style
4. Think about the document outline

## ✅ Testing

- [ ] Page has exactly one h1
- [ ] All major sections use h2
- [ ] Subsections use h3
- [ ] No heading levels are skipped
- [ ] Structure is logical and easy to follow
- [ ] Each heading has some content below it
