# Exercise 1: Click Counter ⭐

## 🎯 Objective

Build a button that displays how many times it's been clicked.

## 📋 Requirements

- A button with text "Click Me!"
- A paragraph showing "Clicks: 0"
- Each click should increment the counter

## 🎁 Bonus Challenges

- Change the button color based on click count:
  - 0-9 clicks: Blue
  - 10-19 clicks: Green
  - 20+ clicks: Purple

## 💡 Hints

- Use `addEventListener('click', ...)` to listen for button clicks
- Store the count in a variable
- Update the paragraph's `textContent` with the new count
- Use `element.style.background` to change colors

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Read the instructions on the page
3. Write your code in the designated areas
4. Test by clicking the button multiple times

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Button increments counter on each click
- Counter display updates correctly
- Reset button works (bonus)
- Button color changes based on count (bonus)

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- Event listeners
- DOM manipulation
- Variables and state
