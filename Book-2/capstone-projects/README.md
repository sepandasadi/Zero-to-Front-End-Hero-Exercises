## 🚀 How to Approach These Projects

### 1. Build Progressively
Start with Project 1 to establish solid patterns, then tackle more complex projects:
- **Project 1:** CRUD + localStorage patterns
- **Project 2:** Builds on Project 1 + adds API integration
- **Project 3:** Combines everything + complex state management

### 2. Read the Entire README First
Understand the full scope before writing code:
- Read requirements.md thoroughly
- Review rubric.md for evaluation criteria
- Skim hints.md to know help is available
- Check out starter files

### 3. Follow the Checkpoints
Break large problems into smaller, achievable milestones:
- Each project has implementation milestones
- Complete one before moving to the next
- Test thoroughly after each milestone

### 4. Test As You Go
Don't wait until the end to test functionality:
- Test each feature as you build it
- Use console.log liberally during development
- Test error scenarios (what if API fails?)
- Test on different browsers

### 5. Refactor When Needed
Your first solution doesn't have to be perfect:
- Get it working first
- Then improve code quality
- Extract repeated code into functions
- Add comments for complex logic

### 6. Embrace Debugging
Use Developer Tools effectively:
- Console for logging state
- Debugger for step-through
- Network tab for API requests
- Application tab for localStorage
- Review Chapter 17 (Developer Tools) when stuck

### 7. Try Stretch Goals
Push yourself beyond the requirements:
- Extension ideas in each project README
- Add features that interest you
- Experiment with new patterns
- Make it your own!

## 📊 Evaluation

### Self-Assessment Rubrics

Each project includes a detailed rubric evaluating:

- **Functionality (40%)** - Core features work correctly
- **Code Quality (25%)** - Clean, organized, efficient code
- **User Experience (20%)** - Smooth, intuitive, responsive
- **Error Handling (10%)** - Graceful failures, helpful messages
- **Polish (5%)** - Animations, loading states, attention to detail

**Target:** 90+ points for portfolio-quality work

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's ✅
- Start with HTML structure before JavaScript
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Write functions that do one thing well
- Handle errors gracefully
- Test edge cases (empty inputs, network failures)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Comment complex logic (not obvious code)
- Save and commit your work frequently
- Deploy your projects when complete

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't use frameworks/libraries (pure JavaScript only!)
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't ignore loading states
- Don't make assumptions about data
- Don't use global variables unnecessarily
- Don't forget to clean up event listeners and timers
- Don't copy code you don't understand

## 🧰 Debugging Checklist

When something's not working:
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Use console.log to trace execution
- [ ] Verify event listeners are attached
- [ ] Check if data is in expected format
- [ ] Ensure async operations complete
- [ ] Validate API responses
- [ ] Test with hardcoded data first
- [ ] Review hints.md for common issues
- [ ] Break problem into smaller pieces
