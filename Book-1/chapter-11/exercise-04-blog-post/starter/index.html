      <h2>Why Learn Web Development?</h2>
      <p>In today's digital age, web development skills are more valuable than ever. From creating personal blogs to building complex applications, the web is where ideas come to life. Here's why you should consider learning web development:</p>

      <ul>

      <h2>The Core Technologies</h2>
      <p>Web development is built on three fundamental technologies:</p>

      <h3>HTML - The Structure</h3>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure and content of web pages. It's the skeleton that holds everything together.</p>

      <h3>CSS - The Style</h3>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) makes websites beautiful. It controls colors, layouts, fonts, and all visual aspects of your site.</p>

      <h3>JavaScript - The Behavior</h3>
      <p>JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It's what makes web pages come alive and respond to user actions.</p>

      <blockquote>
