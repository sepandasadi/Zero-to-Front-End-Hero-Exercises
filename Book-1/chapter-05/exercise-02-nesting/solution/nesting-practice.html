  <h1>My Favorite Books</h1>

  <!-- First paragraph with various text emphasis -->
  <p>
    Reading has been my passion for years. I love getting lost in
    <strong>epic fantasy worlds</strong> and discovering stories that make me think.
    Some books are <em>impossible to put down</em>, while others require careful
    contemplation. My absolute favorite moments are when I find a book that is
    <strong><em>both thrilling and thought-provoking</em></strong> at the same time!

    My all-time favorite book is "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss.
    You can find it on
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Patrick-Rothfuss/dp/0756404746"

    if you'd like to check it out. It's a beautifully written fantasy novel about
    a legendary hero telling his own story!
