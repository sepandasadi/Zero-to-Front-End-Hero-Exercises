4. **Read errors** - They tell you what's wrong
5. **Practice daily** - Consistency beats intensity
6. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn
7. **Teach others** - Best way to solidify knowledge

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

**First Steps:**
1. **Read error messages carefully** - They usually point to the problem
2. **Use console.log()** - Debug by printing values at each step
3. **Check the browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors (F12)
4. **Review the chapter** - Go back to relevant examples
5. **Check hints.md** - Available in project folders

**Technical Resources:**
- **[MDN JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** - Comprehensive documentation
- **[JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)** - Detailed tutorials and explanations
- **[Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/)** - Official Node.js API docs
- **Book Appendices** - Quick reference guides

**Community Support:**
- **GitHub Discussions** - Ask questions and share solutions
- **GitHub Issues** - Report errors or typos in exercises

### Common JavaScript Issues & Solutions

**Problem: "Uncaught ReferenceError: X is not defined"**
- ✅ Check spelling of variable/function names
- ✅ Ensure variable is declared before use
- ✅ Check scope - variable may not be accessible where you're using it
- ✅ For DOM elements, ensure script runs after HTML loads (put `<script>` before `</body>`)

**Problem: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined"**
- ✅ The object/variable is `undefined` or `null`
- ✅ Check that API calls or queries succeeded
- ✅ Use optional chaining: `object?.property` (Chapter 7)
- ✅ Add null checks: `if (object) { ... }`

**Problem: "My async code doesn't work / returns undefined"**
- ✅ Make sure you're using `await` with async functions
- ✅ Check that the function is declared with `async` keyword
- ✅ Use `.then()` or `await` to handle promises
- ✅ Add `.catch()` or try/catch to see errors

**Problem: "npm install fails"**
- ✅ Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need 18+)
- ✅ Delete `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`, then retry
- ✅ Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- ✅ Check for typos in package.json
- ✅ Try with elevated privileges if permission errors

**Problem: "My code works in the console but not in the file"**
- ✅ Check file is saved
- ✅ Ensure script tag is correctly linked in HTML
- ✅ Check for typos in file path
- ✅ Look for syntax errors that prevent script from running
- ✅ Check browser console for error messages

**Problem: "Event listener isn't firing"**
- ✅ Ensure element exists when addEventListener is called
- ✅ Check event name spelling (`'click'`, not `'onclick'`)
- ✅ Verify selector targets the correct element
- ✅ Use event delegation for dynamically added elements

**Problem: "Tests are failing"**
- ✅ Read the test error message - it shows what's expected vs actual
- ✅ Check that your function returns (not just logs) the value
- ✅ Ensure you're handling edge cases (empty arrays, null values)
- ✅ Run `npm test` to see detailed error output

### Debugging Workflow

**Step-by-Step Debugging:**
1. **Identify where the problem occurs** - Use `console.log()` to track execution
2. **Check values at each step** - Log variables to see what they contain
3. **Use browser DevTools** - Set breakpoints and step through code
4. **Isolate the problem** - Comment out code to narrow down the issue
5. **Test small pieces** - Verify each function works independently
6. **Compare with solution** - See what's different in the working version
