## 🎉 All Done?

**Congratulations!** You've successfully set up a professional development environment. You're using the same tools that developers at Google, Facebook, and Netflix use every day.

**What if something didn't work?**

Don't worry! Here's what to do:

1. **Go back to Chapter 4** and re-read the section for the tool that's not working
2. **Restart your computer** (sometimes this fixes everything!)
3. **Close and reopen your terminal/VS Code** after installing new software
4. **Check the version requirements** - make sure you downloaded the correct version
5. **Try uninstalling and reinstalling** the problematic tool

**Still stuck?** That's okay! Troubleshooting is part of being a developer. Try:
- Googling the exact error message you see
- Checking the official documentation for that tool
- Asking for help in developer communities

**Ready for the next step?** Move on to Chapter 5 to develop the right developer mindset! 🚀
