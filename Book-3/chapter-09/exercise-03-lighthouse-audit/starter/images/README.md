# Images Folder

## 📸 Instructions

For this exercise, you'll need to add some large test images to this folder to simulate the performance issues.

### Option 1: Download Free Stock Photos

Download 7 high-resolution images (2000×1500px or larger) from:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)

**Name them:**
- `hero-large.jpg` (for header)
- `photo1-large.jpg`
- `photo2-large.jpg`
- `photo3-large.jpg`
- `gallery1-large.jpg`
- `gallery2-large.jpg`
- `gallery3-large.jpg`
- `gallery4-large.jpg`

### Option 2: Use Your Own Photos

Use any high-resolution photos you have and name them as above.

### Expected Issues

These large images (2-3MB each) will cause:
- ❌ Poor Lighthouse performance score
- ❌ Slow page load
- ❌ High bandwidth usage
- ❌ Poor mobile experience

### Your Task

As part of the exercise, you'll need to:
1. Resize images to appropriate dimensions
2. Convert to WebP/AVIF
3. Add lazy loading
4. Add width/height attributes

This will dramatically improve the Lighthouse score!
