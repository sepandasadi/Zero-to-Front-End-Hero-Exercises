# Exercise 2: Client-Server Research

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how client-server architecture works through research and documentation.

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Research the following concepts:**
   - What is a client in web development?
   - What is a server?
   - What is HTTP/HTTPS?
   - What happens when you type a URL and press Enter?
   - What is DNS?

2. **Create a diagram** showing the flow of a web request from client to server and back

3. **Write explanations** in your own words (don't just copy from sources)

4. **Create a document** (`client-server-notes.md`) with your research
