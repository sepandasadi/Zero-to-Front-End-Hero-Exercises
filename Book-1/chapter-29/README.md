### The `this` Keyword

#### Exercise 10: Method vs Loose Function ⭐⭐

---

### Scope and Hoisting

#### Exercise 13: Lexical Scope ⭐
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time:** 10 minutes
**Focus:** Nested function scope

See how inner functions access outer variables.

---

#### Exercise 14: Hoisting Comparison ⭐⭐
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Focus:** var vs let/const hoisting

#### Exercise 15: Function Declaration vs Expression Hoisting ⭐⭐
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Focus:** Function hoisting differences

Learn which functions are hoisted and which aren't.

**[Start Exercise](./exercise-15-function-hoisting/)**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Closures seem hard but they're just functions that remember
2. **Use the console** - Test every example, tweak values, experiment
3. **Break it down** - If confused, simplify the example until it makes sense
4. **Mental models help** - Closures = backpacks, prototypes = backup plans
5. **`this` is about HOW** - Not where a function is defined, but how it's called
6. **Use modern syntax** - Prefer `let`/`const` over `var`, classes over constructors

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Create and use closures for private data
- ✅ Write and use higher-order functions
- ✅ Understand and work with prototypal inheritance
- ✅ Predict and control the value of `this`
- ✅ Understand scope chains and hoisting behavior
- ✅ Read and write professional JavaScript code
