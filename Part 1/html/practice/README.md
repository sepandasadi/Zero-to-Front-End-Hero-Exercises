## Validation Checklist

Use this checklist for each exercise:

- [ ] HTML validates (use [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/))

- [ ] No console errors

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Build the structure first, worry about styling later

3. **Think Accessibility**: Consider users with screen readers
4. **Validate Often**: Check your HTML as you go
