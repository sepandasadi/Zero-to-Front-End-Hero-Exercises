# Exercise 1: Create Your First HTML Page

## 🎯 Goal

Write a complete HTML5 document from scratch to solidify your understanding of HTML structure.

## 📋 Requirements

Create a file called `my-first-page.html` that includes:

### HTML Structure:
- [ ] `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- [ ] `<html>` element with `lang="en"` attribute
- [ ] Complete `<head>` section
- [ ] Complete `<body>` section

### Head Section Must Include:
- [ ] `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- [ ] `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- [ ] `<title>` with a descriptive title

### Body Section Must Include:
- [ ] An `<h1>` heading with your name
- [ ] A paragraph (`<p>`) introducing yourself
- [ ] Another paragraph about why you're learning web development

## 💡 Hints

- Start by typing `!` in VS Code and pressing Tab - it will create a basic HTML structure!
- Make sure every opening tag has a matching closing tag
- Proper indentation makes code easier to read
- Open the file in your browser to see your page!

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your page should:
- Display your name as a large heading
- Show two readable paragraphs
- Have a descriptive title in the browser tab
- Have no console errors (press F12 to check)
- Pass HTML validation at https://validator.w3.org/

## 🚀 Bonus Challenges

- [ ] Add a comment explaining each section
- [ ] Add a third paragraph about your goals
- [ ] Use `<strong>` or `<em>` to emphasize words in your paragraphs
- [ ] Add a second heading (`<h2>`) to organize sections
